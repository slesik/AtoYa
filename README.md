## Structure & Leading

The main screen shows you the 33 letters of the Russian alphabet.

Every time you choose one of them the background color of the letter will change to remind you which letters were already opened.

When you tap on a letter you will see how to write it in upper and lower case and at bottom of screen you'll find two buttons: If you tap the left one (**"Listen It"**) you will listen how to pronunce this letter, and if you tap the right one (**"Try It"**) an animal with a name starting with the selected letter will appear and you'll hear its name.

### Example:
*If you tap the letter "**A**", you'll see a picture of "**A**кyла" ("shark" in Russian) *
* **Exceptions**: Three Russian letters - **"ъ"**, **"ы"**, **"ь"** - are special, there are no words which start with these letters. In their places you'll find some words which contain these letters.

To return at the main screen you've to tap at the top blue button (*"Back"*).
 
If you want to clear the selection of seen letters on the main screen, there's a button with a broom icon at the bottom right corner.

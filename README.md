## Structure & Leading

The main screen shows you 33 letters of the Russian alphabet.

Every time when you choose one of the 33th letters its color will change to remind you which letters were opened.

If you want to learn the letter pronunciation you just have to tap on it. Two types of letter writing proposed: UPPERCASE & lowercase.

At bottom of screen you'll find two buttons: the left one (**"Listen It"**) propose you to listen a pronunciation of a letter, if you tap the right one (**"Try It"**) an animal image will appear and you'll hear the animals' name. The first letter of the animals' name corresponds to the chosen letter.

### Example:
*If you tap to letter "**A**", you'll see a picture of "**A**кyла" ("shark" in Russian) *
* **Exceptions**: Three Russian letters - **"ъ"**, **"ы"**, **"ь"** - are the exceptions, there are no words which start with these letters. In their places you'll find some words which contain these letters.

To return at the main screen you've to tap at the top blue button (*"Back"*).
 
If you want to clear the selection of seen letters on the main screen, there's a green button with a broom icon at the  right bottom corner.
